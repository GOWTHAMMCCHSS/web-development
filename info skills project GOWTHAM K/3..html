The company was established in December 1998 as a subsidiary of Take-Two Interactive, using the assets Take-Two had previously acquired from BMG Interactive. Founding members of the company were Terry Donovan, Gary Foreman, Dan and Sam Houser, and Jamie King, who worked for Take-Two at the time, and of which the Houser brothers were previously executives at BMG Interactive. Sam Houser heads the studio as president.</font><br><br><b><font size=3>Since 1999, several companies acquired by or established under Take-Two have become part of Rockstar Games, such as Rockstar Canada (later renamed Rockstar Toronto) becoming the first one in 1999, and Rockstar Dundee the most recent in 2020. All companies organized under Rockstar Games bear the Rockstar name and logo. In this context, Rockstar Games is sometimes also referred to as Rockstar New York, Rockstar NY or Rockstar NYC.

In exchange, Take-Two was to issue 1.85 million shares (around 16%) of its common stock to BMG Entertainment. Through this acquisition, Take-Two obtained several of BMG Interactive's former intellectual properties, including DMA Design's Grand Theft Auto and Space Station Silicon Valley. The deal was announced to have closed on March 25.Three BMG Interactive executives—Dan Houser, Sam Houser, and Jamie King—as well as Gary Foreman of BMG Interactive and Terry Donovan of BMG Entertainment's Arista Records record label, subsequently moved to New York City to work for Take-Two Interactive. In a restructuring announced that April, Sam Houser was appointed as Take-Two's vice president of worldwide product development.In December 1998, the Houser brothers, Donovan and King established Rockstar Games as the high-end publishing label of Take-Two.The formation was formally announced on January 22, 1999.<br><br><hr><b><u><font size=5>GAMES</u></font></b><br><br><b><li>Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #1 – London 1969<br><li>Grand Theft Auto: Mission Pack #2 – London 1961<li>Grand Theft Auto 2<li>Grand Theft Auto III<li>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City<li>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas<li>Grand Theft Auto IV<li>Red Dead Redemption<li>Grand Theft Auto V<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</b><br><hR><b><u><font size=5>OTHER PROJECT</u></font><br><br><font size=5>Rockstar Loft<font><br><b><font size=3>In 1999, Donovan and Sam Houser cooperated with John Davis to establish the Rockstar Loft club night. Davis had co-founded and been the promoter for Body & Soul, a no-guestlist, no-velvet rope party held weekly at Tribeca's Club Vinyl. When Rockstar Games founder originally arrived in New York City, former DJ Donovan was particularly impressed with Body & Soul, and they became close with the club night's team, including Davis and its other founder, DJ François K. Davis had sought to establish further such events, while Donovan and Houser wanted to get publicity for the young Rockstar Games, thus they established Rockstar Loft. According to Donovan, the event was to serve as an alternative those that were overly expensive or had attendees 'bulldozed by security'. He precluded video game installations at the venue to focus on the music and highlight the artists.")}
